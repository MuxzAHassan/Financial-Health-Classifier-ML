# Financial Health Classifier

This is my final year project, using Python and its libraries to predict and classify students' financial health class. 
The result is categorized only into 2; Good or Bad. 
Utilizing sk-learn, pandas, Numpy, and many other libraries to visualize and train the data.
The dataset however contains sensitive and confidential information about students' financial information such as monthly income/allowance, expenses, part time employment, living area, vehicle possession, personal and student debt info etc.
So, the dataset would not be provided in this.
